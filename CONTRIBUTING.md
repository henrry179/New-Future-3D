* **Use a clear and descriptive title**
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement**
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**
* **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead**

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

* [Beginner issues](https://github.com/yourusername/newfutures-vfx/labels/beginner) - issues which should only require a few lines of code
* [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/yourusername/newfutures-vfx/labels/help%20wanted) - issues which should be a bit more involved

## Development Setup

1. **Install Python 3.10+**
   ```bash
   # Check Python version
   python --version
   ```

2. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/newfutures-vfx.git
   cd newfutures-vfx
   ```

3. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # Development dependencies
   ```

5. **Set up pre-commit hooks**
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

6. **Run tests**
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

## Style Guidelines

### Python Style Guide

We use [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for Python code formatting and follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

```bash
# Format code
black src/

# Check code style
flake8 src/

# Sort imports
isort src/
```

### Documentation Style

* Use clear and concise language
* Include code examples where appropriate
* Update the README.md if needed
* Add docstrings to all public functions and classes

Example docstring:
```python
def apply_effect(video_path: str, effect_name: str, **kwargs) -> str:
    """
    Apply a visual effect to a video file.
    
    Args:
        video_path: Path to the input video file
        effect_name: Name of the effect to apply
        **kwargs: Additional parameters for the effect
        
    Returns:
        Path to the processed video file
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If the effect name is not recognized
        FileNotFoundError: If the video file doesn't exist
    """
```
